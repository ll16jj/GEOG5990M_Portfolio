 GEOG 5990M Programming Assessment 1 Portfolio
 
 This project is about the generation of a finalised Agent-Based Model. 
 
 The model shows a set of agents in an environment, where the agetns move and eat the environment over a set number of iterations. The data for the x and y values are gathered through the web via soups in the form of a URL,
 and data for the environment is extracted and then appened from a text file using csv reader. The agents interact with each other and its environment, they move and eat the environment, and when they are close to each other
 they will share their store which they recieved from eating the environment. Information on my portfolio can be found on the github repository https://ll16jj.github.io/GEOG5990M_Portfolio, simply download the IndexJJ.html. Alternatively, the website codes, 
 links and python code for solely the Agent-Based Model can be found and downloaded in the github repository https://ll16jj.github.io/GEOG5990M_Portfolio as model.py and agentframework.py.
